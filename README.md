## • How do I approach designing software?
For this class, I approached designing the software starting with analyzing the requirements for each week’s assignment/milestone. I looked at all the requirements first so that I had an idea of what needed to be done. From there, I used that knowledge along with the provided guides and class instruction to come up with possible ways to build out each feature/milestone. I also used paper + pencil to draw out shapes so I had a better idea of the different vertices and sides needed to make each object in my project.

## • How do I approach developing programs?
For this class, I approached developing the software from a “continuous improvement” perspective. My first goal was to get each new feature/addition to work. Once I achieved that goal, I started to improve my code by looking at which lines of code were repeated, unneeded, could be done simpler, etc. I then created branches to build out these improvements. Once the improvements were complete and working, I merged them into my already working code base. I did this each week and with every new addition/feature and improvement that I did to my project.

## • How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I feel that this class really helped me with my ability to read and interpret code/programs that I didn’t write myself. We were given tutorial code and guides for this class along with being referred to learnOpenGL.com. but never told explicitly how/where to implement things. While I do think that being able to build feature’s/products on your own is a requirement for a job in the software engineering field, you won’t always be the sole developer on a program/project. When working on a team, you need to be able to understand code and features written by your fellow developers and I feel that this class helped me develop this skillset. Furthermore, I used git/version control A LOT during this class. Version control is practically a requirement for any major program/project and the skills I gained during this class in the use of this tool will undoubtedly server me on my educational and professional journey.
